# ZaneyOS FAQ for v2.3 
- **Revision v0.4**  
- **Date:** 14-Mar-2025

## Why did you create ZaneyOS ?
 
Orginally, it was simply my configuration saved on a GIT repository. It was there to promote NixOS and Hyprland. Providing a stable, working configuration.  It has never been intended as a full NixOS distro.  The `ZaneyOS` was an inside joke among friends.  The intent is this can be used as a daily driver, play games via steam, and be modified to fit your needs. 

## How do I change the Timezone? 

1. In the file, `~/zaneyos/modules/core/system.nix`  
2. Edit the line:  time.timeZone = "America/New_York"; 
3. Save the file and rebuild using the `fr` alias.
   
## How do I change the monitor settings? 

 Monitor settings are in the file:  `~/zaneyos/hosts/<HOSTNAME>/variables.nix`

 Inside the quotes the syntax is "monitor=video apapter,resolution@refresh rate, auto,scale" 
 Monitor must be in all lowercase.  If you are not sure of your video devices run 
 `hyprctl monitors` at a terminal CLI.  The output will look similar to this: 

```
hyprctl monitors
Monitor HDMI-A-1 (ID 0):

```

Edit the `extraMonitorSettings` line.
**Examples:**
- Single Monitor: 
	    `extraMonitorSettings = "monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,auto,1";`
- Multiple Monitors:
            `extraMonitorSettins = "
            monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,auto,auto
            monitor=HDMI-A-1,2560x1440@75,auto,auto
            ";` 

Information on configuring monitors is available on the Hyprland Wiki

##  How do I add applications to ZaneyOS? 

###  There are two options. One for all hosts you have, another for a specific host.

1.  For applications to be included in all defined hosts edit the 
	`~/zaneyos/modules/core/packages.nix` file.  
        
There is a section that begins with: 
	` environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; `

Followed by a list of packages These are required for ZaneyOS. 

We suggest you add a comment at the end of the package names. Then add in your packages. 

```
            e.g. 
            ...
            virt-viewer
            wget
            ###  My Apps ### 
            bottom
            dua
            emacs-nox
            fd
            gping
            lazygit
            lunarvim
            luarocks
            mission-center
            ncdu
            nvtopPackages.full
            oh-my-posh
            pyprland
            shellcheck
            multimarkdown
            nodejs_23
            ugrep
            zoxide
        
        ];
        }
```

2.  For applications that will only be on specific host. 
   
You edit the `host-packages.nix` associated with that host. 
	`~/zaneyos/hosts/<HOSTNAME>/host-packages.nix` 

The part of the file you need to edit, looks like this: 

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    audacity
    discord
    nodejs
    obs-studio
  ];
}
```
    
You can add additional packages, or for example change `discord` to `discord-canary` to get the beta version of Discord but only on this host. 

## I added the package names, now how do I install them ? 

- Use the `fr`,  Flake Rebuild  alias. 

If the rebuild completes successfully, a new generation with your added packages will be created. 

## How do I update the packages I've already installed? 

- Use the `fu`, Flake Update alias. This will check for updated packages, download and install them.

## I made a change to my ZaneyOS configuration, how do I activate it? 

- Use the `fr` Flake Rebuild alias. If you **created a new file** please note you will need to run a `git add .` command in the zaneyos folder. If successful, a new generation will be generated with your changes. A logout or reboot could be required depending on what you changed. 

## I have older generations I want to delete, how can I do that? 

- The `ncg` NixOS Clean Generations alias will remove **ALL** but the most current generation. Make sure you have booted from that generation before using this alias. There is also a schedule that will remove older generations automatically over time. 

## How do I change the hostname?  

To change the hostname, there are several steps and you will have to reboot to make the change effective. 

1. Copy the directory of the host you want to rename to a directory with the new name. 

- `cp -rpv ~/zaneyos/hosts/OLD-HOSTNAME ~/zaneyos/hosts/NEW-HOSTNAME `

2. Edit the `~/zaneyos/flake.nix` file. Change the line:

- `host = "NEW-HOSTNAME"`  
    
3.  In the `~/zaneyos` Directory run `git add .` *The rebuild will fail with a 'file not found' error if you forget this step.*

4.  Use the `fr` alias to create a new generation with the new hostname.  You must reboot to make the change effective. 

## How do I update my version ZaneyOS ? 

###  For versions v2.3+ 

1. First backup your existing  `zaneyos` directory.

- `cp -rpv ~/zaneyos ~/Backup-ZaneyOS`

*Any changes you made to the ZaneyOS config will need to be re-done*

2. In the `zaneyos` directory run `git stash && git pull` 

3. Copy back your previously created host(s). 

- `cp -rpv ~/Backup-ZaneyOS/hosts/HOSTNAME  ~/zaneyos/hosts `

4. If you did not use the `default` host during your initial install

- Then  do not copy the `default` host from your backup. The new default host might have updates or fixes you will need for the next host you create.**
- Then you will have to manually compare your backup to the new updated `default` host template, and potentially merge the changes and overwrite your `hardware.nix` file to the `~/zaneyos/hosts/default/hardware.nix` file.**

5. In the `zaneyos` directory run `git add .` when you have finished copying your host(s).  

6. For any other changes you've made. For example: hyprland keybinds, waybar config, if you added additional packages to the `modules/packages.nix` file.  Those you will have to manually merge back into the new version. 

### For versions v2.0->2.2

1. First backup your existing  `zaneyos` directory.  e.g. `cp -r ~/zaneyos ~/zaneyos-backup`
 
2. There is no direct update. When you clone the the new config the config files and layout have changed.

3. You need to install zaneyos like a new install.  `./install-zaneyos.sh`

4. Once the build completes and you have rebooted you can review the new layout and decide what if any changes you made on the earlier version can be migrated to v2.3.

### For version v1.x 

1. The layout and configuration are completely different. Virtually noting from 1.x is applicable to v2.3.

2. Backup your `zaneyos` directory e.g. `cp -r ~/zaneyos ~/zaneyos-backup`

3. Run the `./install-zaneyos.sh` script and follow the new install instructions. 

## How do I know when a new version of ZaneyOS is released? 

It will be announced on the Zaney [Discord](https://discord.gg/W7efsSDS) server.

## How do I configure my hybrid laptop with Intel/NVIDIA GPUs? 

1. Either run the `install-zaneyos.sh` script and select `nvidia-laptop` template or if configuring manually, set the template in the `flake.nix` to `nvidia-prime`  

2. In the `~/zaneyos/hosts/HYBRID-HOST/variables.nix` file you will need to set the PCI IDs for the Intel and NVIDIA GPUs. Refer to [this page](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nvidia) to help determine those values.

3. Once you have everything configured properly, use the `fr` Flake Rebuild alias to create a new generation. 

4. In the `~/zaneyos/modules/home/hyprland/config.nix` file is an ENV setting` "AQ_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/card0:/dev/dri/card1"` This sets the primary and secondary GPUs. Using the info from the weblink above you might have to change the order of these values.

## What are the Kitty keybindings and how can I change them? 

  The kitty bindings are configured in `~/zaneyos/modules/home/kitty.nix`  
  
  The defaults are:

## What are the Yazi keybindings and how can I change them? 

The Yazi configuration file is located in `~/zaneyos/modules/home/yazi.nix`

Yazi is configured like VIM and VIM motions 

The keymap is in the `~/zaneyos/modules/home/yazi/keymap.toml` file
