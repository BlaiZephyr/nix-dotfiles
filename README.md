## Installation:

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These installation methods are for **NEW INSTALLATIONS
> ONLY**. If you already have ZaneyOS installed and want to upgrade to v2.4, see
> the [Upgrade Instructions](#upgrading-from-zaneyos-23-to-24) below. Note:
> There is an issue with upgrade script. It's been removed until it's fixed.

<details>
<summary><strong> ⬇️ Install with script (NEW INSTALLATIONS ONLY)</strong></summary>

### 📜 Script:

This is the easiest and recommended way of starting out for **new
installations**. The script is not meant to allow you to change every option
that you can in the flake or help you install extra packages. It is simply here
so you can get my configuration installed with as little chances of breakages
and then fiddle to your hearts content!

> **⚠️ WARNING:** This script will completely replace any existing ~/zaneyos
> directory. Do NOT use this if you already have ZaneyOS installed and
> configured.

Simply copy this and run it:

![ZaneyOS First Install Command](img/first-install-cmd.jpg)

```
nix-shell -p git curl pciutils
```

Then:

![ZaneyOS Install Script Command](img/install-script.jpg)

```
sh <(curl -L https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/raw/stable-2.4/install-zaneyos.sh)
```

#### The install process will look something like this:

![First Part Of Install](img/1.jpg)

![Second Part Of Install](img/2.jpg)

#### After the install completes your environment will probably look broken. Just reboot and you will see this as your login:

![Display Manager](img/3.jpg)

#### Then after login you should see a screen like this:

<details>
<summary><strong> 🦽 Manual install process:  </strong></summary>

1. Run this command to ensure Git & Vim are installed:

```
nix-shell -p git vim
```

2. Clone this repo & enter it:

```
cd && git clone https://gitlab.com/zaney/zaneyos.git -b stable-2.4 --depth=1 ~/zaneyos 
cd zaneyos

You can still run the `install.sh` script if you want to.
```

- _You should stay in this folder for the rest of the install_

3. Create the host folder for your machine(s) like so:

```
cp -r hosts/default hosts/<your-desired-hostname>
git add .
```

4. Edit `hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/variables.nix`.

5. Edit `flake.nix` and fill in your username, profile, and hostname.

6. Generate your hardware.nix like so:

```
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/hardware.nix
```

7. Run this to enable flakes and install the flake replacing hostname with
   profile. I.e. `intel`, `nvidia`, `nvidia-laptop`, `amd-hybrid`, or `vm`

```
NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" 
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#profile
```

Now when you want to rebuild the configuration you have access to an alias
called `fr` that will rebuild the flake and you do not have to be in the
`zaneyos` folder for it to work.

## Upgrading from ZaneyOS 2.3 to 2.4 -- At this time do NOT user the upgrade script

> **🚀 IMPORTANT:** If you already have ZaneyOS 2.3 installed, use the automated
> upgrade system instead of reinstalling!

### ✅ Automated Upgrade Process:

ZaneyOS includes a comprehensive upgrade system that safely migrates your
configuration:

```bash
cd ~/zaneyos
./upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
```

### 🔍 What the Upgrade System Does:

1. **Pre-Upgrade Analysis** - Comprehensive scan of your customizations
2. **Complete Backup** - Full backup of your current configuration
3. **Automatic Migration** - Preserves all your settings and customizations
4. **Safe Upgrade** - Uses `boot` option to prevent display manager conflicts
5. **Easy Revert** - One-command rollback if needed

### 📋 What Gets Automatically Migrated:

- ✅ All host configurations and variables
- ✅ Hardware configurations
- ✅ Custom packages (both global and per-host)
- ✅ Themes, wallpapers, and monitor settings
- ✅ Git configuration and personal settings
- ✅ Terminal preferences with automatic enabling

### ⚠️ What Requires Manual Attention:

- Custom flake.nix inputs
- Personal shell configuration files (zshrc-personal.nix, etc.)
- Custom module modifications

### 📚 Complete Documentation:

For detailed upgrade instructions, troubleshooting, and safety information:

- **Read**: `UPGRADE-2.3-to-2.4.md` in your zaneyos directory
