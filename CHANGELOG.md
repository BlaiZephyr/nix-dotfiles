## üóíÔ∏è Changelog

**ZaneyOS 2.0**

With this new update of ZaneyOS it is a big rewrite of how things are being done. This update fixes many issues that you guys were facing. As well as makes things a little easier to understand. You now have a lot being stored inside the specific host directory, making use of modules, condensing seperate files down, etc. 
My hope is that with this update your ability to grasp the flake and expand it to what you need is much improved. I want to thank everyone for being so supportive!

- Most configuration put into specific hosts directories for the best portability.
- Using modules to condense configuration complexity.
- Simplified options and the complexity around understanding their implementation.
- Rewrote the documentation for improved readability.

- Centered the Wofi window always.
